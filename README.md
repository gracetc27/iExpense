# iExpense 
Project 7 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app originally was made using User defaults to save its data, but I have since updated to use SwiftData.
The app allows users to add an expense item to a list, giving a price and a category (business or personal).  
# Features
- Using @Observable.
- Making items in a list deletable.
- Using a sheet.
- Working with codable and identifiable.
- Introduction to User defaults.
- Later updated with SwiftData
